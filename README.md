# Express Note Taking App

## Description

This app uses node.js and express to allow the user to take notes which are then 
saved and reloaded on the page the next time it is open by writing the notes to the db.json folder.

I built this project to learn how to use express and write GET, POST, and DELETE routes for the html pages and api routes used in this project.

## Installation

No installation needed

## Usage

From the home page you click on the tab in the center of the screen where you will be taken to a page where you can add a note title and note text and then save the note to the left side of the page. Saved notes can be deleted by clicking the red trash can next to each note.
